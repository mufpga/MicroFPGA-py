# MicroFPGA Python library

[MicroFPGA](https://mufpga.github.io) is an FPGA-based platform for the electronic control of microscopes. It aims at using affordable FPGA to generate or read signals from a variety of devices, including cameras, lasers, servomotors, filter-wheels, etc. It can be controlled via [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), or its [Java](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-java), Python and [LabView](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-labview) communication libraries, and comes with optional complementary [electronics](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-electronics).

## Content

This repository contains the Python communication library. Examples on how to use the library can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-py/tree/main/examples). We advise created a conda environment specifically for microfpga.
