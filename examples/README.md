In order to use the examples, install `microfpga` in your conda environment:

```bash
pip install microfpga
```

or install it from the source code:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-py
cd MicroFPGA-py
pip install -e .
```

Then plug-in your configured FPGA and run the python scripts from the command line or using your favorite IDE.

Note that in order to use the notebook, install jupyter: `pip install jupyter`. Additionally, one of the example script uses `matplotlib`.
